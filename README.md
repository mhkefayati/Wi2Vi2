# Sample Generated Videos for the Wi2Vi2 Model
-  [Wi2Vi2-one2one.mp4](Wi2Vi2-one2one.mp4): Movie file containing the CSI samples (model input) and the three views generated by the two models in the [1](#paper). In this figure, the model was trained on samples acquired while subject one was present in the environment. The test samples were from non-overlapping times while subject one was presented in the environment.
